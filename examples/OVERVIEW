OVERVIEW of the security protocol models deployed with 'scyther-proof'
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Created: 13/05/11

The examples contained in the same directory as this OVERVIEW file and in its
subdirectories are part of the distribution of the 'scyther-proof' tool. They
are intended to serve as a starting for verifying your own protocols.

The meaning of the subdirectories is the following:

  classic
    
    These are models of well-known protocols. They serve as documentation and
    regression tests for the scyther-proof tool.

  iso9798

    These are the models and proofs of our repaired versions of the
    authentication protocols from the ISO/IEC-9798 standard, as described in
    Basin, Cremers, Meier. "Provably Repairing the ISO/IEC 9798 Standard for
    Entity Authentication". 2011. to be published.

    See the 'Makefile' for conventient execution and checking of these proof
    scripts. If you want to load the proof scripts in Isabelle's interactive
    ProofGeneral interface, then please consult the
    '$SCYTHER_PROOF/isabelle/README' file for installing the custom keywords
    file.
