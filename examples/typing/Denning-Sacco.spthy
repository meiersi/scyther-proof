section{* Denning-Sacco Shared Key Protocol *}

  Modeled after the description in the SPORE library:

    http://www.lsv.ens-cachan.fr/Software/spore/denningSacco.html

  Notable differences:

    1. We do not yet have support for reasoning about timestamps.

    2. We are using explicit global constants instead of implicit typing to
       discern the different encryptions.

    3. Similar to the model in Isabelle/OFMC, we added a transfer of some
       arbitrary payload to show that the session key really works as intended.

       Note, that we do not require this, as we could also formulate the
       session-key secrecy property directly. See the our example models in the
       'examples' directory.

  Note that the following authentication properties only ensure the existence
  of partner threads of a certain structure and not the uniqueness.
  
  The stronger property of session key freshness has to be specified and proven
  in Isabelle/HOL on the basis of the automatically produced proofs for the
  properties specified in this input file of ScytherP.
