Purpose: Describe Status of Modelling SPORE Protocols
Author:  Simon Meier <simon.meier@inf.ethz.ch>
Date:    23.6.2010


%% Approach
%%%%%%%%%%%

Shortcomings of our model:

  - weak support for verifying key freshness: only interactive verification of
    injective authentication properties

  - no support for timestamps; currently we model timestamps as nonces. This
    may be too strong!

  - no algebraic properties of functions like 'succ' are modeled.


Naming convention:

  - file and theory are named according to title with special chars dropped and
    spaces and hyphens replaced by an underscore
  - protocol in a theory is named according to author or standard

Selecting variants of a protocol:

  - For now we select the variant with no claimed attacks if it exists. We may
    also choose to provide models for more variants to demonstrate our attack
    finding ability.


TODOs for the tool:

  - switch uncompromised to uncompromised
  - separate transfer label using '.'
  - open-source licence
  - output input file and isabelle certificate
  - comment out unsound theorems when outputting them to Isabelle,
    but output message to terminal about them

TODOs for explanations:

  - interaction with HTML output
  - syntax (splitting transfers)
  - tagging / untyped model
  - properties not yet verifiable

=====================

GJM
The goal of this protocol is to achieve distributed contract signing in an abuse-free way, that is no party ever can prove to a third party that he is able of determining the issue of the exchange (validate or invalidate the contract). To achieve this goal, a special construction called private contract signature is introduced. Such a private contract signature has the particular property that it is meaningful only for a given trusted third party. Moreover, this protocol is optimistic in the sense that the trusted third party is required only in case of problem.

%% Notes to be discussed with Cas and David
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Andrew Secure RPC:
  - Lowe's attack on BAN concrete Andrew RPC is based on identity swapping due
    to the single shared bidirectional key. This attack is also possible on the
    original protocol and its modified version that fixes the orignal's
    freshness flaw.
