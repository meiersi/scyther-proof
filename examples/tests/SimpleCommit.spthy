section{* Simple commitment protocol *}

text{*
  In this protocol, agent C commits itself to a data value c, which we model as
  a nonce. The predefined public-key infrastructure is used to identify C.
  We allow the verifier V to be compromised, such that the adversary could fully
  impersonate V. The hiding property, which is proven for the adversary,
  therefore extends to V.

property (of SimpleCommit) hiding:
  premises
    "role(1) = C"

  imply
    "step(1, C_3)"

property (of SimpleCommit) binding:
  premises
    "role(0) = V"
    "step(0, V_4)"
    "uncompromised(C#0)"
  injectively imply a thread 1 such that
